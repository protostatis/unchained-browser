# Publishing

This document records release and distribution workflows for `unbrowser`.
It is intentionally separate from `skills/unbrowser/SKILL.md`, which is user-facing.

## Artifact Matrix

- GitHub Release: automated in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- PyPI (`pyunbrowser`): automated in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- crates.io (`unbrowser` crate): manual `cargo publish`
- Homebrew tap: manual update of `protostatis/homebrew-tap`
- ClawHub skill: manual `clawhub publish ...`

## GitHub Release + PyPI

1. Bump `Cargo.toml` and `python/pyproject.toml` together.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. Tag the release: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. The `release.yml` workflow builds the binaries, creates the GitHub Release,
   and publishes Python wheels + sdist to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing.

## crates.io

1. Ensure `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is available in the environment.
2. Bump `Cargo.toml` version.
3. Run `cargo publish` from the repo root.

## Homebrew tap

Repo: `https://github.com/protostatis/homebrew-tap`

1. Release `unbrowser` first so the GitHub Release tarballs exist.
2. Update or clone the tap repo.
3. Run `./bin/update-shas.sh vX.Y.Z` in the tap repo.
4. Review the diff in `Formula/unbrowser.rb`, then commit and push.

The tap repo’s `bin/update-shas.sh` helper fetches the tarballs for the given
tag, computes the sha256s, updates `Formula/unbrowser.rb`, and prints a diff.

## ClawHub skill

1. Bump `skills/unbrowser/SKILL.md` `version:` frontmatter.
2. Commit and push the skill change.
3. Publish manually:

```bash
clawhub publish skills/unbrowser --version X.Y.Z --changelog "..."
```

ClawHub does not auto-sync from GitHub, and it requires `--version` explicitly.
It will reject a reused version with `Version already exists`.
